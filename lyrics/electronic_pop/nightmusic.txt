She'd be, she'd be on the sun
Love could always may come and go
Do you wanna say oh
Guys do not wanna say
Anything in front of me
Love do you wanna say oh
Guys do not wanna say
Everything I wanna say
I don't wanna say, I don't wanna say
Jimmy Jimmy understand
Love could always may come and go
To the night, oh
I've been hard to run up in the snow
You've been liking anywhere to go
Tonight's the night I awaited 'til the end
Tonight's the night and I will see its end
So it's underwater and you caught it
You would never let it go, oh, oh, oh
Tonight's the night I awaited 'til the end
Tonight's the night and I will see its end
So it's underwater and you caught it
You would never let it go, oh, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh
She'd be, she'd be on the sun
Love could always may come and go
Do you wanna say oh
Guys do not wanna say
Anything in front of me
Go, don't wanna stay
I sleep in the day and dance in the night
I sleep in the day and dance in the night
I sleep in the day and dance in the night
I sleep in the day and dance in the night
I sleep in the day and dance in the night
I sleep in the day and dance in the night
I sleep in the day and dance in the night
I sleep in the day and dance in the night
