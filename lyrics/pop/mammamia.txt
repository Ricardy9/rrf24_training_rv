Oh, ma-mamma mia, spit your love on me
I'm on my knees, and I can't wait to drink your rain
I'll keep it secret if you let me get a taste
Tell me your limit, and we'll cross the line again
Oh, mamma-mamma mia
Give me a command, and I'll do what you ask
'Cause my favorite music's your "Uh, uh"
Give me a command, and I'll do what you ask
'Cause my favorite music's your "Uh, uh"
Give me a command, and I'll do what you ask
'Cause my favorite music's your "Uh, uh"
Give me a command, and I'll do what you ask
'Cause I love when you sing out loud
Oh, mamma-mamma mia, spit your love on me
I'm on my knees, and I can't wait to drink your rain
I'll keep it secret if you let me get a taste
Tell me your limit, and we'll cross the line again
Oh, mamma-mamma mia
Spit your love on me
Spit your love on me
Spit your love on me
Spit your love on me
Oh, mamma-mamma mia
