Most likely to get married, class of 1980
It's there in black and white up on a shelf
Damn, they look so happy
Wish Mom had kept that jacket
And Dad had kept the Firebird he had to sell
And I guess they stayed together just because they wrote forever
On the inside of the cover by their names
They were in love, you can read it
I guess I've just only seen it in a red ink heart around my father's face
They've lived in the same house for almost forty years now
But the last day they were on the same page
Was in a yearbook, mm
They never saw it coming, from the bleachers at homecoming
That she'd work late and he'd hide cigarettes
They're still high school sweethearts, just without the good parts
That fifteen yard line grass was green as theirs would ever get
And I guess they stayed together just because they wrote forever
On the inside of the cover by their names
They were in love, you can read it
I guess I've just only seen it in a red ink heart around my father's face
They've lived in the same house for almost forty years now
But the last day they were on the same page
Was in a yearbook
Ooh, too bad the pages only turn one way
Ooh, and it's too damn hard to look at yesterday
And I guess they stayed together just because they wrote forever
On the inside of the cover by their names
They were in love, you can read it
I guess I've just only seen it in a red ink heart around my father's face
They've lived in the same house for almost forty years now
But the last day they were on the same page
Was in a yearbook
Ooh, ooh
Was in a yearbook
